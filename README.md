# 🐄 Zauro - Decentralized Livestock Tokenization & AI Valuation

Zauro (means “cattle pen” in Hausa) is a decentralized platform designed to digitize livestock ownership, valuation, and trading in African communities. Using AI and Hedera blockchain, Zauro transforms animals into financial assets with traceable value, verified health, and peer-to-peer trade capabilities.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

In many African communities:
- Livestock is the primary store of wealth.
- No formal system exists for tracking, trading, or verifying animals.
- Farmers lack access to credit or insurance due to informal ownership.

Zauro solves this by making livestock:

✅ Digitally owned and verified via NFTs  
✅ Valued using AI (images, breed, age, and health)  
✅ Tradable and usable as collateral for loans  
✅ Linked to decentralized health and care logs

## 🧠 AI/ML Features

- **Livestock Value Prediction**: Regression model trained on ILRI data and animal photos.
- **Health Monitoring**: Time-series or image-based classification of potential health issues.
- **Disease Risk Forecasting**: Combines regional outbreaks and vitals for early warnings.
- **Resource Recommendation**: AI suggestions for feed, medicine, or breeding.

---

## ⛓️ Blockchain (Hedera) Components

- **Tokenization (HTS)**: Each animal = NFT with dynamic metadata (health, weight, vet history).
- **File Service (HFS)**: Store OCR hashes of vet reports and transfer records.
- **Consensus Service (HCS)**: Log actions like feeding, vaccination, ownership changes.
- **Smart Contracts**: Enable livestock trading, loan guarantees, and cooperative management.
